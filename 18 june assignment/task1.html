<p>The Mahabharata is a monumental Sanskrit epic of ancient India, traditionally attributed to the sage Vyasa. It tells the story of a great war between two royal families—the Pandavas and the Kauravas—for the throne of Hastinapura. But beyond a war story, it is a deep philosophical, spiritual, and moral text.
